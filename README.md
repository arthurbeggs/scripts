# **Amazing Script Collection**

This repository contains some really useful scripts to install applications, to configure them and to make daily life easier.

## **Licence**

Feel free to copy and modify this scripts. Giving me credit for it is your choice, but please keep references to other people's work, which I don't have ownership and thus cannot decide what to do with the licenses.

I didn't choose a license to apply to my scripts because they may contain snippets from other people and it would be a mess to make every license compatible. I try my best to give credit for other people's work, but if for any reason you found your work in my repo uncredited/ with altered license/ you don't want it here, please open a Issue and I'll remove it :)
